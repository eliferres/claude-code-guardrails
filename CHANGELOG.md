## Unreleased

### Added
- Added a terminal demo to the README's first screen, showing command-guard blocking a recursive force-delete, clearing the one allowlisted build-cache path, and still blocking a neighbour path.
- Added CI runs on macos-latest alongside ubuntu-latest, which is what would have caught the fixture bug below.

### Changed
- Added full type hints to all 27 functions in guardrails.py, with no behavior change.
- Split `liveness()` from one 57-line function into read-manifest, check-guard, and print-report phases.

### Fixed
- Fixed fixture paths to resolve through realpath so the test suite passes on macOS, where test 7 compared an unresolved mktemp path against the guard's already-resolved target and never matched.
